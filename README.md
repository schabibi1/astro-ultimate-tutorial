## ‚ùì FAQ
- Where I should look when I get lost during the workshop? ‚Üí Jump to the relevant branch following the name of the tutorial part. (i.e. Go to `part-1` branch when you get lost in **Ultimate Tutorial part 1**)

- I don't think my environment variable is working. ‚Üí Make sure you have `.env` file in the **root directory** and it has `STORYBLOK_TOKEN` variable with your Storyblok **preview** API key token. (i.e. `STORYBLOK_TOKEN=your-token`)

- Storyblok CLI retunrs errors when I run `storyblok push-components` ‚Üí Logout once if you already have used Storyblok CLI. Then, login again with `storyblok login` command.

```bash
storyblok logout
storyblok login
```
